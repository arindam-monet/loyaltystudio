# Shopify Integration Implementation

This document outlines the implementation details of the LoyaltyStudio Shopify integration.

## Overview

The Shopify integration allows merchants to manage their loyalty programs directly within the Shopify admin interface. It provides a seamless experience for merchants and customers, with real-time data synchronization between Shopify and LoyaltyStudio.

## Architecture

The integration follows a microservice architecture with the following components:

1. **Shopify Embedded App**: A Remix.js app embedded in the Shopify admin
2. **LoyaltyStudio API**: The main API for loyalty program management
3. **Theme App Extensions**: Shopify theme extensions for storefront integration
4. **Webhooks**: Real-time data synchronization between Shopify and LoyaltyStudio

## Implementation Details

### Shopify Embedded App

The Shopify embedded app is built using Remix.js and the Shopify App Bridge. It provides the following features:

- Authentication via Shopify OAuth
- Merchant onboarding and setup
- Loyalty program management
- Rewards and points management
- Analytics and reporting

The app uses Shopify's Polaris design system to provide a native Shopify experience for merchants.

### Database Schema

The Shopify integration uses its own database with the following tables:

- `Session`: Shopify session data
- `MerchantMapping`: Mapping between Shopify merchants and LoyaltyStudio merchants
- `WebhookSubscription`: Registered webhooks for each merchant
- `ShopifySettings`: Merchant-specific settings for the Shopify integration

### API Integration

The Shopify app communicates with the LoyaltyStudio API using the `LoyaltyStudioApiClient`. This client handles authentication and API requests to the main LoyaltyStudio system.

The API client provides methods for:

- Creating and updating merchants
- Syncing customers
- Processing orders
- Managing rewards and points
- Retrieving loyalty program data

### Webhooks

The integration uses Shopify webhooks to receive real-time updates for:

- Orders (create, update, cancel)
- Customers (create, update)
- App uninstallation

Webhook handlers process these events and update the LoyaltyStudio system accordingly.

### Theme App Extensions

The Theme App Extensions provide customer-facing loyalty program features:

- Points balance display
- Rewards catalog
- Checkout integration

These extensions are implemented using Shopify's Theme App Extensions framework, which allows for seamless integration with the merchant's storefront.
