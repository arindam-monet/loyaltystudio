## Technical Decisions & Updates

### Package Naming Convention
- Using `@loyaltystudio/` as the package namespace for all workspace packages
- This includes:
  - `@loyaltystudio/api` - Fastify API Gateway service (includes auth and db)
  - `@loyaltystudio/ui` - Shared UI components
  - `@loyaltystudio/eslint-config` - Shared ESLint configuration
  - `@loyaltystudio/typescript-config` - Shared TypeScript configuration
  - `@loyaltystudio/client-sdk` - OpenAPI-generated client

### Architecture Overview
- **Monolithic API Approach**:
  - Fastify API Gateway contains all backend logic
  - Auth and database modules integrated within API
  - Unified API documentation using Scalar
  - Frontend apps communicate exclusively through Fastify API
  - Clear separation between frontend and backend concerns

### API Structure
- **Auth Module** (`api/src/auth/`):
  - Supabase client configuration
  - Authentication middleware
  - User management
  - Token handling
  - RBAC implementation

- **Database Module** (`api/src/db/`):
  - Prisma client setup
  - Database migrations
  - Multi-tenant schema
  - Connection pooling
  - Query utilities

- **Routes** (`api/src/routes/`):
  - REST API endpoints
  - WebSocket handlers
  - Request validation
  - Response formatting

- **Services** (`api/src/services/`):
  - Business logic
  - Integration with auth/db
  - External service communication
  - Background jobs

- **Middleware** (`api/src/middleware/`):
  - Request processing
  - Error handling
  - Logging
  - Rate limiting
  - Tenant isolation

### API Documentation
- Using Scalar API Reference for unified documentation
- Combines both Fastify and Supabase endpoints in one interface
- Features:
  - Interactive API playground
  - Authentication examples
  - Rate limiting information
  - Webhook documentation
  - Integration guides
  - SDK examples
- Integration with Fastify through `@scalar/fastify-api-reference`

### Authentication Flow
1. Frontend authenticates through Fastify API
2. Fastify API uses Supabase client for auth operations
3. JWT tokens managed server-side
4. Real-time subscriptions handled through Fastify WebSocket endpoints

### Logging Infrastructure
- Using Pino (v8.17.2) as the default logger
- Pino is a low-overhead logging library that works seamlessly with Fastify
- Added pino-pretty for development environment to improve log readability
- Logging configuration includes:
  - Pretty printing in development
  - JSON format in production
  - Customizable log levels
  - Performance-optimized logging
  - Supabase operation logging

### Frontend Integration
- Frontend apps use generated TypeScript client SDK
- SDK provides type-safe API calls
- Authentication handled through Fastify endpoints
- Real-time features through Fastify WebSocket endpoints
- No direct Supabase client usage in frontend

### Security Measures
- Supabase credentials kept server-side only
- Custom rate limiting per tenant
- Additional security layers through Fastify middleware
- Comprehensive audit logging
- DDoS protection via Cloudflare

### Performance Optimization
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Optimized Supabase client usage
- Efficient WebSocket handling
- CDN integration for static assets
