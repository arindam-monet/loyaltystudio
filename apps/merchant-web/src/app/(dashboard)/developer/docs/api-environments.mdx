# API Environments

Loyalty Studio provides two separate environments for API integration:

## Test Environment

- Base URL: `https://api-test.loyaltystudio.com/v1/`
- Purpose: Development, testing, and integration
- Features:
  - Test data is periodically reset
  - Higher rate limits for development
  - Sandbox integrations for payment processors
  - No charges for points or rewards

## Production Environment

- Base URL: `https://api.loyaltystudio.com/v1/`
- Purpose: Live customer-facing applications
- Features:
  - Persistent data
  - Standard rate limits
  - Real integrations with payment processors
  - Normal charges for points and rewards

## Best Practices

1. Always develop and test your integration in the test environment first
2. Use test API keys for development and staging environments
3. Only use production API keys in your live application
4. Keep your production API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code

## API Keys

Each environment requires its own set of API keys. You can create and manage your API keys in the [API Management](/developer/api) section.

### Test API Keys

Test API keys are for development and testing purposes. They have higher rate limits to facilitate development and testing, but they only work with the test environment.

### Production API Keys

Production API keys are for live applications. They have standard rate limits and should only be used in production environments. These keys only work with the production environment.

## Environment-Specific Behavior

Some API endpoints may behave differently depending on the environment:

1. **Payments**: In the test environment, payment integrations use sandbox modes that don't process real transactions.
2. **Notifications**: In the test environment, email and SMS notifications are sent to test recipients only.
3. **Rate Limits**: Test environment has higher rate limits to facilitate development and testing.
4. **Data Persistence**: Test data may be periodically reset, while production data is persistent.
